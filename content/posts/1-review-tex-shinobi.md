# Review: TEX Shinobi DIY Edition

I've needed a portable keyboard that I can use when I'm away from my day-to-day office. My primary keyboard is a Kinesis Advantage2, which I've modified with Kailh Box Jade switches. My laptop is a Thinkpad, and I've always loved the feel and layout of Thinkpad keyboards. However, if I were to buy something, it should have mechanical switches, preferably Box Jades. I started looking around and found the TEX Shinobi.

The TEX Shinobi is a 7-row keyboard modeled after the Thinkpad T25 laptop keyboard and is available as a prebuilt and DIY version.

I ended up getting the DIY bundle version, which comes with the Shinobi keyboard and their BLE 5.0 Bluetooth module. The DIY version uses hot-swap sockets, making it possible to build the keyboard without any soldering.

It took roughly 1.5 weeks from order placement until the keyboard was delivered to my door, which is insanely fast when you think about the logistics of moving it across the globe. When it arrived, I was ready with a set of Kailh Box Jade switches.

The build took approximately 2 hours to complete.

## The Good

The build quality is overall very good. I would have liked the option to buy the Shinobi with an aluminum case instead of the plastic one, as that would have significantly improved it. However, there's nothing inherently wrong with the plastic case.

The keycaps feel nice. Some people have reported that the letter printing fades over time, but I don’t see that as a negative. It will give the keyboard a nice patina with time, I think.

Typing on the keyboard is comfortable, and I haven't had any issues once I got it built and working correctly.

## The Bad

I have two things I'm not super happy about.

1. The keyboard and BLE module did not work as expected when I first built the keyboard. After some troubleshooting, I decided to try updating the firmware of both the keyboard and the BLE module. I would have expected these to be updated from the factory to the latest version, but that wasn’t the case. I haven’t had a computer with Windows for the last three years, and since TEX only supports updating firmware from Windows, this was a minor issue for me. I reinstalled a laptop with Windows and updated the firmware, and everything was fine.
2. The keys on the keyboard are smaller than those on a regular keyboard; I’d guess they are about 15% smaller. I haven't found any official information about this, and if I'd known about it before buying, I might not have bought it. Since I have RSI, using the keyboard for multiple days is unfortunately making the pain flare up.

## Overall

I'm happy with the purchase and I enjoy using the keyboard for short stretches at a time to keep the RSI under control. I'll monitor the TEX website in case they decide to release the Kodachi as a DIY edition, as that model comes with an aluminum body, which would be even more desirable than the Shinobi in my opinion.
